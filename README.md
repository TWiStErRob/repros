# repros
Repro projects for issues I report.

## Structure
 * Each top level folder represents a tool/software I use.
 * Inside each top level folder there are subfolders for specific issue repros. These issues are named with a slug.
 * Inside each repro folder there's a README.md file, where the first line is a link to the issue tracker where the problem is reported.
